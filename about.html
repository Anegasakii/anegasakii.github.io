	<p class="blockName">Me</p>
	<p> There haven't been a lot of good tech classes at the schools I've been in, so I've been teaching myself the basics of coding! <br>
	It's definitely nothing great, but I'm happy with most of what I've done. <br>
	For specific learning hubs, I started with <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">Codecademy</a>, but I use <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">Freecodecamp</a> when I can. <br>
	I'm just a silly child that doesn't know what to do in life but has found a couple fun things to do.
