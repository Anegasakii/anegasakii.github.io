		<p>Sep 2020<br>
		Notion, a note taking app, is very good at making complex databases that you can filter and sort through.<br>
		But I also like using simple tables in my notes, so I built a tool to automatically make compatible, paste-able math equation code that'll make simple tables.</p>

		<p>Sep 2020<br>
		I'm not really sure what to do or what's worth putting on the Internet,<br>but I do have an account on this thing since I don't know a lot about hosting websites. You're even on one of the things I made with it!</p>

		<p>Nov 2020<br>
		A friend said "Enigma machine time lets go" after discussing an assignment about text compression,<br>so now this repo exists<br>
		[still very much in progress, 0 encryption happens and there aren't even any configuration options]</p>
