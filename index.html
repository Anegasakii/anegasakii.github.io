				<h1>Repl.it</h1>
				<h2>Oct 2019 - May 2020</h2>
			</header>
			<p>Before I even used Notepad++, I learned Python in this browser IDE. Both of the dates are guesses, though.<br>
			The start is based on when my Codecademy account was made.<br>
			The end is when the most recent update to a repl was.</p>

				<h1>P5JS</h1>
				<h2>July - Sep 2020</h2>
			</header>
			<p>A lot of random toys to teach myself how to JavaScript.<br>
			I might've downloaded & tried Notepad++, but I continued doing stuff in browsers because this canvas was fun to learn and play with.</p>

				<h1>Notion Tables</h1>
				<h2>Sep 2020</h2>
			</header>
			<p>Notion, a note taking app, is very good at making complex databases that you can filter and sort through, but I also like using simple tables in my notes, <br>
			so, before they added the function natively, I built a tool to automatically make compatible, paste-able math equation code that'll make simple tables.</p>

				<h1>GitHub</h1>
				<h2>Sep 2020</h2>
			</header>
			<p>I'm not really sure what to do or what's worth putting on the Internet,<br>
			but I do have an account on this thing since I don't know a lot about hosting websites. You're even on one of the things I made with it!</p>
		</a>
		<a href="https://anegasakii.github.io/AP-Bio-Flashcards/">
			<header>
				<h1>AP Bio Flashcards</h1>
				<h2>Sep 2020</h2>
			</header>
			<p>I had to make flashcards for an assignment, but I didn't feel like making actual phsyical cards, so I had some fun with it.</p>
		</a>
		<a href="https://anegasakii.github.io/Effective-Raw/">
			<header>
				<h1>Effective Raw Calculator</h1>
				<h2>Oct 2020</h2>
			</header>
			<p>This was made just so I had something to add within the month, and I was in the middle of comparing a bunch of gear for Monster Hunter.</p>
		</a>
		<a href="https://anegasakii.github.io/Enigma-Machine/">
			<header>
				<h1>Enigma Machine</h1>
				<h2>Nov 2020</h2>
			</header>
			<p>A friend said "Enigma machine time lets go" after discussing an assignment about text compression, and now this exists.<br>
			[Still incomplete. There's wheels and it might actually successfully encode and decode stuff (don't trust me on that),
			but you still can't rearrange the wheels and there's no plugboard.]</p>
		</a>
		<a href="https://codepen.io/anegasaki" target="_blank">
			<header>
				<h1>CodePen</h1>
				<h2>Nov 2020 - Dec 2020</h2>
			</header>
			<p>FreeCodeCamp has some assignments where you make a project that can pass its testing suite, which is in CodePen.<br>
			It tells you how to add the testing stuff in something else, but I was lazy, so I just made a CodePen account for that stuff.</p>

		<a href="https://anegasakii.github.io/Related-Rates-Project/">
			<header>
				<h1>Related Rates Project</h1>
				<h2>Sep 2021</h2>
			</header>
			<p>A quick thing I made in p5.js for school. It gets its own page because it also has to be presented.</p>
		</a>
		<a href="https://anegasakii.github.io/Jackbox-Sorted/">
			<header>
				<h1>Jackbox Sorted</h1>
				<h2>New Years! 2023</h2>
			</header>
			<p>A friend got *every Jackbox pack* and we were incredibly unprepared to find which pack had which games,
			and trying to look it up usually gave ranked lists or the very large official and wiki pages.<br>
			Here's my solution, complete with way too much work and somehow still very low quality for what it is!</p>
		</a>
		<a href="https://anegasakii.github.io/PMD-Quiz/">
			<header>
				<h1>PMD Quizzes</h1>
				<h2>May 2023</h2>
			</header>
			<p>After I got in the mood to replay Explorers of Darkness, I found only a few guides on per-question points,
			and even fewer recreations of <em>any</em> of the games' intros, so I figured I'd try making one that had the features that I'd want.<br>
			I originally planned to include all the games as well as an almost reverse version (where you choose a Pok√©mon and it highlights how to answer), but I got bored and busy, so those are only "maybe"s now.</p>
