				<h1>Repl.it</h1>
				<h2>Oct 2019 - May 2020</h2>
			</header>
			<p>Before I even used Notepad++, I learned Python in this browser IDE. Both of the dates are guesses, though.<br>
			The start is based on when my Codecademy account was made.<br>
			The end is when the most recent update to a repl was.</p>

				<h1>P5JS</h1>
				<h2>July - Sep 2020</h2>
			</header>
			<p>A lot of random toys to teach myself how to JavaScript.<br>
			I might've downloaded & tried Notepad++, but I continued doing stuff in browsers because this canvas was fun to learn and play with.</p>

				<h1>Notion Tables</h1>
				<h2>Sep 2020</h2>
			</header>
			<p>Notion, a note taking app, is very good at making complex databases that you can filter and sort through, but I also like using simple tables in my notes, <br>
			so, before they added the function natively, I built a tool to automatically make compatible, paste-able math equation code that'll make simple tables.</p>

				<h1>GitHub</h1>
				<h2>Sep 2020</h2>
			</header>
			<p>I'm not really sure what to do or what's worth putting on the Internet,<br>
			but I do have an account on this thing since I don't know a lot about hosting websites. You're even on one of the things I made with it!</p>

				<h1>AP Bio Flashcards</h1>
				<h2>Sep 2020</h2>
			</header>
			<p>I had to make flashcards for an assignment, but I didn't feel like making actual phsyical cards, so I had some fun with it.</p>

				<h1>Effective Raw Calculator</h1>
				<h2>Oct 2020</h2>
			</header>
			<p>This was made just so I had something to add within the month, and I was in the middle of comparing a bunch of gear for Monster Hunter.</p>
		</a>

			<header>
				<h1>Enigma Machine</h1>
				<h2>Nov 2020</h2>
			</header>
			<p>A friend said "Enigma machine time lets go" after discussing an assignment about text compression, and now this exists.<br>
			[Still incomplete. There's wheels and it might actually successfully encode and decode stuff (don't trust me on that),
			but you still can't rearrange the wheels and there's no plugboard.]</p>

				<h1>CodePen</h1>
				<h2>Nov 2020 - Dec 2020</h2>
			</header>
			<p>FreeCodeCamp has some assignments where you make a project that can pass its testing suite, which is in CodePen.<br>
			It tells you how to add the testing stuff in something else, but I was lazy, so I just made a CodePen account for that stuff.</p>

				<h1>Related Rates Project</h1>
				<h2>Sep 2021</h2>
			</header>
			<p>A quick thing I made in p5.js for school. It gets its own page because it also has to be presented.</p>
