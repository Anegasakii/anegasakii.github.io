		<p>Oct 2019 - May 2020<br>
		Before I even used Notepad++, I learned Python in this browser IDE. Both of the dates are guesses:<br>
		The start is based on when my Codecademy account was made.<br>
		The end is when the most recent update to a repl was.</p>

		<p>July - Sep 2020<br>
		A lot of random toys to teach myself how to JavaScript.<br>I might've downloaded & tried Notepad++, but I continued doing stuff in browsers because this canvas was fun to learn and play with.</p>

		<p>Sep 2020<br>
		Notion, a note taking app, is very good at making complex databases that you can filter and sort through.<br>
		But I also like using simple tables in my notes, so I built a tool to automatically make compatible, paste-able math equation code that'll make simple tables.</p>

		<p>Sep 2020<br>
		I'm not really sure what to do or what's worth putting on the Internet,<br>but I do have an account on this thing since I don't know a lot about hosting websites. You're even on one of the things I made with it!</p>

		<p>Sep 2020<br>
		Had to make flashcards for an assignment but didn't feel like making actual phsyical cards, so I had some fun with it.</p>

		<p>Oct 2020<br>
		Felt like finishing something within the month and am too lazy to go to a calculator and put in numbers myself.</p>

		<a class="blockName" href="https://anegasakii.github.io/Enigma-Machine/">Enigma Machine</a>
		<p>Nov 2020<br>
		A friend said "Enigma machine time lets go" after discussing an assignment about text compression, and now this exists.<br>
		[Still incomplete. There's wheels and it might actually successfully encode and decode stuff (but don't trust me on that)<br>but you still can't rearrange the wheels and there's no plugboard.]</p>

		<p>Nov 2020 - Dec 2020<br>
		FreeCodeCamp has some assignments where you make a project that can pass its testing suite, which is in CodePen.<br>
		It tells you how to add the testing stuff in something else, but I'm lazy so I just made a CodePen account for that stuff. Here it is!</p>

		<p>Sep 2021<br>
		Quick thing I made in <a href="https://p5js.org">p5.js</a> for school. It gets its own page because it also has to be presented.</p>
